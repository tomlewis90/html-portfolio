<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 12+ year experienced Senior Development Manager (Property) based in the UK.
  Despite having a career I have found success in, a job that I genuinely do enjoy, I have
  the decision to pursue a direction that I know my passion lies in. In 2024 I am undertaking the task of 
  learning Software Engineering to enable me to make the jump, and pursue a new direction in my career. I have set myself a
  goal to be in a new role in 2025, and I will document my progress as I go along.
</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>
After losing my father in late 2023, I have spent alot of time thinking about what I want in life, 
the direction I am going, where I live and where do I want to be. I have a beautiful wife, I have an lovely home in Bath, England, 
I have a great job that supports me hugely... but... I know deep down, despite all this, and despite being in a position I could take the "easier" 
road and keep pushing upwards in my current career something I telling me I know it is not where I see my future and its time to commit to what I really want. 
So here we are! 
</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Learn the essential skills</li>
  <li>Build on these skills until I find confidence to create my own projects</li>
  <li>Build 5 key projects for potential recruiters</li>
  <li>Secure a job in 2025</li>
</ul>
